Rather than deal with Config Hell, just build this for Linux with a few slight mods.

You can tail -1 this file and pipe to sh and it works.
./configure CC=x86_64-ros-gcc CFLAGS=-Dros --host x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu  enable_rtlookup=none enable_drvlookup=none enable_omni=no LIBS="-lbenchutil -lbsd"
